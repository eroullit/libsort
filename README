A simple library to help me re-learn the classic sorting algorithms I've long since forgotten from University days.

To create the library, try 'make'

The 'test' directory contains trivial test programs that I'm using to verify basic code functionality.

STATUS:

    * three sorting algorithms
        * a slightly optimized version of bubblesort
        * mergesort (plus a version which malloc's once at top frame)
        * in-place quicksort (plus a version which malloc's once at top frame)
    * test/insort.c - contains a trivial integer sorting test which excercises
        the bubblesort and ascending/descending integer comparison functions

TODO
    * pull the memory comparison & swapping out from bubblesort into the library
    * improve the testing to use some kind of assertion-based framework
    * performance tuning & benchmarking metrics?
