A simple library to help me re-learn the classic sorting algorithms I've long since forgotten from University days.

To create the library, try 'make'

The 'test' directory contains trivial test programs that I'm using to verify basic code functionality.

STATUS:

    * there is one sorting algorithm, a slightly optimized version of bubblesort
    * test/insort.c - contains a trivial integer sorting test which excercises
        the bubblesort and ascending/descending integer comparison functions

TODO
    * implement more sorting algorithms (quicksort, insertion, mergesort, ???)
    * pull the memory comparison & swapping out from bubblesort into the library
    * improve the testing to use some kind of assertion-based framework
    * performance tuning & benchmarking metrics?
